### Streamlit application with fairlearn

 - The purpose of this article is to show and stepwise build a fully functioning Stremlit app by leveraging Fairlearn’s capabilities in light of the possible biased AI solution. With the help of a fair AI system framework, we can identify and rectify any potential disparities in lending decisions based on confidential attributes, ultimately bolstering our commitment to fair lending practices. This approach not only aligns with regulatory requirements but also fosters the institute’s dedication to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusivity in the lending industry. It’s a testament to our commitment to creating a level playing field for all applicants and contributing to a more just financial landscape.
